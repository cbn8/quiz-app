"What is the purpose of the 'var' keyword in JavaScript?","MCQ","It declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.","It declares a block-scoped variable, only available within the block.","It's used to declare a constant value that cannot be changed.","It is a shorthand for 'variable', but has no functional use.","The 'var' keyword is used for variable declaration and optional initialization in JavaScript."
"What does '===' operator signify in JavaScript?","MCQ","It compares both value and type.","It assigns a value to a variable.","It only compares the value, ignoring the type.","It increments a variable's value by three.","The '===' operator is a strict comparison operator that checks for both value and type equality."
"Which method is used to parse a JSON string into an object?","MCQ","JSON.parse()","JSON.stringify()","Object.parseJSON()","String.parse()","JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string."
"What is a Promise in JavaScript?","MCQ","An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.","A function that runs as soon as it is defined.","A data structure for storing multiple elements.","A way to execute code at regular intervals.","A Promise in JavaScript represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation."
"How do you declare a function in JavaScript?","MCQ","function myFunction() {}","var myFunction = new Function();","var myFunction();","function:myFunction() {}","A function in JavaScript is declared using the 'function' keyword followed by a name, and then the function body enclosed in curly braces."
"Which statement is true about arrow functions in JavaScript?","MCQ","They do not have their own 'this' context.","They can be used as constructors.","They have their own 'this' context.","They are the only way to declare functions in ES6.","Arrow functions do not have their own 'this' context; instead, 'this' refers to the enclosing execution context."
"What does the 'map' method do in JavaScript?","MCQ","It creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.","It changes the original array by applying a function to each element.","It searches an array for a value and returns its index.","It iterates over an array and executes a function for each element, without creating a new array.","The 'map' method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array."
"In JavaScript, which object is the top of the prototype chain?","MCQ","Object.prototype","Function.prototype","String.prototype","Array.prototype","In JavaScript, Object.prototype is at the top of the prototype chain; all objects ultimately inherit from it."
"What does 'hoisting' refer to in JavaScript?","MCQ","Variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.","The process of optimizing code execution by moving functions to the top.","A feature that automatically elevates variable values to the highest possible value.","A method of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.","In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the process where the interpreter moves variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope before code execution."
"What is the primary purpose of the 'async' keyword in front of a function in JavaScript?","MCQ","It makes a function return a Promise.","It ensures the function runs synchronously.","It optimizes the function for faster performance.","It automatically catches any errors within the function.","The 'async' keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, which returns a Promise."
