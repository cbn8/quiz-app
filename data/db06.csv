Determine the maxima for each relationship: Student-Takes-Course,MCQ,many-many,one-one,many-one,one-many,"Each student can take many courses, and each course has many students, so Student-Takes-Course is many-many."
Determine the maxima for each relationship: City-IsCapitalOf-State,MCQ,one-one,one-many,many-one,many-many,"A city is capital of at most one state, and each state has one capital city. City-IsCapitalOf-State is one-one."
Determine the maxima for each relationship: Airport-Has-Runway,MCQ,one-many,one-one,many-one,many-many,A runway is located in only one airport. So Airport is singular. An airport can have many runways. So Runway is plural.
Determine the maxima for each relationship: Person-Owns-Vehicle,MCQ,many-many,many-one,one-one,one-many,"A person can own many vehicles and, in most states, a vehicle can have many registered owners. Person-Owns-Vehicle is many-many."
Determine the minima for each relationship: Person-Marries-Person,MCQ,zero-to-zero,zero-to-one,one-to-many,one-to-one,"Since a person can be unmarried, Person-Marries-Person is zero-zero."
Determine the minima for each relationship: Person-Has-Passport,MCQ,one-to-zero,one-to-many,one-to-one,zero-to-one,"Every passport must belong to a person, but not all people have a passport. Person-Has-Passport is one-zero."
Determine the minima for each relationship: Flight-ArrivesAt-Airport,MCQ,one-to-one,one-to-many,zero-to-one,one-to-zero,"All flights must arrive at an airport. Assuming the database does not track new or inactive airports, all airports have arriving flights. Flight-ArrivesAt-Airport is one-one."
"Determine the maximum and minimum of each attribute: Entity Airport, attribute AirportCode",MCQ,singular-required,singular-optional,plural-required,required-singular,"Each airport has at most one code, so AirportCode is singular. Every airport has a code, so AirportCode is required."
"Determine the maximum and minimum of each attribute: Entity Person, attribute SpouseName",MCQ,singular-optional,singular-required,plural-required,required-singular,"In most countries, each person has at most one legal spouse, so SpouseName is singular. A person may be unmarried, so SpouseName is optional."
"Determine the maximum and minimum of each attribute: Entity Employee, attribute LanguageCode",MCQ,plural-required,plural-optional,singular-required,required-singular,"An employee may speak several languages, so LanguageCode is plural. Each employee speaks at least one language, so LanguageCode is required."
Cardinality' refers to relationships only.,TrueFalse,False,True,,,Cardinality is a general term for minima and maxima of both relationships and attributes.
"In ER diagrams, maxima and minima are drawn for relationships only.",TrueFalse,False,True,,,Minima and maxima for both attributes and relationships can appear in ER diagrams.
Maxima and minima usually depend on business rules.,TrueFalse,True,False,,,"Although some maxima and minima are universal, most depend on business rules and are determined during interviews and document review."
"In the analysis phase, cardinality is always determined after discovery is complete.",TrueFalse,False,True,,,"In principle, discovery precedes determination of cardinality. However, analysis is an iterative process. In practice, cardinality is determined in parallel with discovery, and additional discovery takes place after cardinality is determined."
Each project has at most one code. The ProjectCode attribute is _____.,MCQ,singular,unique,plural,required,"Singular' means each entity instance has at most one attribute value. This is the case for ProjectCode, so ProjectCode is singular."
Each project code describes at most one project. The ProjectCode attribute is _____.,MCQ,unique,singular,plural,required,"Unique' means each attribute value describes at most one entity instance. This is the case for ProjectCode, so ProjectCode is unique."
A project may have no code. The ProjectCode attribute is _____.,MCQ,optional,required,plural,singular,"Optional' means an entity instance may have no attribute value. This is the case for ProjectCode, so ProjectCode is optional."
Distinguishing strong and weak entities is a logical design activity.,TrueFalse,False,True,,,The distinction between strong and weak entities does not depend on a specific database system. Activities that document database requirements without regard to a specific database system are part of the analysis phase.
Determining cardinality always precedes distinguishing strong and weak entities.,TrueFalse,False,True,,,"Analysis activities are not always done in sequence. Analysis is iterative and, occasionally, steps are done out of order."
"Database designers may look for identifying relationships first, before noting weak entities.",TrueFalse,True,False,,,Some database designers prefer to focus on identifying relationships rather than weak entities.
